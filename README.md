Hangover53 is a tool for analysing DNS records. DNS enumeration, finding orphaned DNS records, searching for
subdomains that could be hijacked and more are all intended to be part of this tool's feature set.

It's first iterations will run from the command line. Future versions will run from a container on a cron.
